# TIRADS_Annotator
An open-source tool to generate TI-RADS description for thyroid nodules


## Overview
This web-based application is designed for radiologists and researchers involved in thyroid nodule analysis. It enables users to generate annotations for thyroid nodules using TI-RADS descriptors and could provides automated TI-RADS reports using AI models. This tool aims to facilitate studies on the agreement between radiologist assessments and AI-generated evaluations.

## Features
- **Annotation Using TI-RADS Descriptors:** Users can manually annotate thyroid nodules based on TI-RADS descriptors. This toll will automatically calculate TI-RADS score. 
- **Automated TI-RADS Reporting:** Leverage AI models to generate TI-RADS reports automatically.
- **Comparison Studies:** Conduct studies to compare agreement rates between radiologists and AI assessments.
